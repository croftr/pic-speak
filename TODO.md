1) Templates
When creating a new board it should be possible to either create a blank one or make one from a template. For now lets have 1 template which includes base words. Each of the base words should be in a card made with attractive large funky style lettering. the base word cards it comes with are - Yes, No, Hello, Bye, Thank You, Please. I dont know if you can also provide the audio for these or not, if not then I can provide the audio later.  

2) Allow batch upload of multiple Images.  The user can then edit them to add audio and titles later. They should have a default title, probably just needs to be "New Card" 

3) Think of other template ideas but dont implement them lets consisder

4) Controls at the top of boards when using them to filter "Things" (which are all images) and "Words" which are words such as listed in the template abouve (yes,no,please etc..)

5) Better logo
